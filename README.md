Hi, I'm Jawad Srour.

Senior Software Engineer & Team Lead specializing in modernizing large-scale enterprise systems and building high-performance, cloud-native platforms.

I design and lead the delivery of mission-critical systems used by Fortune 500 companies, financial institutions, and large retail organizations.

My focus is transforming complex, aging, high-traffic platforms into scalable, resilient, and future-proof architectures.

I work end-to-end across:
• System architecture and backend engineering
• Cloud-native platforms and distributed systems
• Performance optimization, caching, and reliability
• CI/CD, infrastructure automation, and zero-downtime releases
• Technical leadership, mentoring, and engineering standards

I’ve contributed to platforms processing billions in transactions, supporting thousands of global endpoints, and operating under strict uptime and performance requirements.

I’m most effective in environments where problems are complex, stakes are high, and strong architectural leadership is needed.

Always love conversations with founders, architects, and engineering leaders building or modernizing large-scale systems.
